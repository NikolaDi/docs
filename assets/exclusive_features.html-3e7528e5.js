Play before Publishing</h2><ul><li><p>Pain point: Unable to play before successful publishing.</p></li><li><p>Scenario:</p><p>In some real-time streaming scenarios, there is a need for simultaneous streaming and playback, typically in a one-to-one setting. For example, in a car recorder based on RTMP streaming, when a user requests to view the live video from the onboard camera and sends a publishing command to the device, the playback of the video starts simultaneously. If the playback request arrives at the media server before the publishing, the server usually returns an error indicating that the stream is not found. To solve this problem, a common approach is to confirm the successful publishing before starting the playback. However, this often increases the delay in opening the video, resulting in a poor user experience. ZLMediakit optimizes this scenario by allowing the server to hold the player&#39;s response if the stream does not exist, and only returns a successful playback response after the publishing is successful. If the publishing does not come online within a timeout period, an error indicating the stream is not found is returned. The delay can be modified through the configuration file:</p><div class="language-ini line-numbers-mode" data-ext="ini"><pre class="language-ini"><code><span class="token section"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token section-name selector">general</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></span>

The common solution is to have the player send periodic heartbeats to keep the device streaming. However, this often leads to uncertainty in the state and increases system complexity (imagine having to maintain streaming heartbeats for the app, web, and mini-program simultaneously). To address this scenario, ZLMediakit provides a playback user statistics feature. When the viewer count reaches zero, it triggers a no viewer event. By receiving the hook (HTTP request) from ZLMediakit, you can decide whether to close the streaming (or pulling) on ZLMediakit&#39;s side.

However, these video contents are generated in real-time and do not exist when there are no viewers (no publishing or pulling proxies). In such scenarios, the usual practice is to restrict the clients. Instead of providing a playback URL directly, an API for obtaining the URL is provided. Users first obtain the playback URL to trigger the device&#39;s publishing, and then they can start playback. This approach is usually cumbersome, requiring specific pre-playback logic and limiting some application scenarios. ZLMediakit provides a stream not found event, allowing you to report to your business server that the stream does not exist.

One approach, which is the default behavior of zlmediakit, is to immediately disconnect all players who are playing the stream and destroy the streaming device and player objects to save resources. Another approach, represented by SRS, does almost nothing when the streaming device is disconnected. It doesn&#39;t reclaim the resources allocated by the streaming device and doesn&#39;t disconnect the players (instead, it allows the players to time out and disconnect automatically).</p><p>The advantage of SRS&#39;s approach is that when the pushing stream device reconnects, the players can continue playing, providing a better user experience. The downside is that resources are not reclaimed in a timely manner. If there are malicious connections that don&#39;t time out actively, it may consume a large number of file descriptors on the server. Additionally, the media source resources created by the pushing stream device cannot be released actively. When multiple pushing stream devices are created, the memory usage cannot be reduced promptly.</p><p>In response to this scenario, zlmediakit has added support for continuous disconnection and reconnection to address the issue of player disconnection caused by streaming reconnection, as well as the problem of unrecycled resources. The approach is to delay the destruction of the media source resource object (and the disconnection of the player) when the streaming device is disconnected. When the streaming device reconnects, the same resource object is reused, allowing the player to continue watching the video. If the streaming device doesn&#39;t come online after a timeout, the player is disconnected and all resources are reclaimed.

Cluster Deployment</h2><ul><li><p>Pain point: Limited traceability methods, edge servers cannot use HLS.</p></li><li><p>Scenario description:</p><p>In general, media streaming clusters are implemented using a traceability method, where servers are divided into origin servers and edge servers. The origin server is typically used to receive streams and does not directly handle user playback requests. Instead, it distributes the streams to edge servers, which in turn deliver them to the players. This model supports a large number of user playback requests. SRS has supported this functionality through configuration files for a long time. Since zlmediakit also provides on-demand pulling of streams, it essentially supports the traceability mode for clustering. However, users need to integrate with hooks and APIs, which has a higher development threshold. Therefore, zlmediakit recently added support for cluster mode through configuration files.

The methods are diverse and rich, and the origin servers are not divided into primary and backup. Load balancing of the origin servers is achieved using the round-robin method. It should be noted that since ZLMediakit has long supported on-demand streaming for HLS, its edge stations also support the HLS protocol (in fact, they support any protocol supported by ZLMediakit), which is not available in SRS.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that ZLMediakit supports both RTSP and WebRTC, both of which are based on RTP. Internally in ZLMediakit, they can be interconnected without the need for protocol conversion and complex multiplexing/demultiplexing logic. This makes it possible to use ZLMediakit for large-scale, low-latency WebRTC live streaming. Compared to traditional CDN based on RTMP, RTSP is more suitable as the underlying transport protocol for WebRTC. Developers do not need to deal with cumbersome multiplexing/demultiplexing logic and can smoothly achieve the interconversion between RTSP and WebRTC.</p></li></ul><h2 id="_6-webrtc-single-port-multi-threading-and-connection-migration-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-webrtc-single-port-multi-threading-and-connection-migration-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6.
